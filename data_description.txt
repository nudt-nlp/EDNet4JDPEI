Following is the basic data processing steps for this code:
(1) There are four files .sent, .tup, and .pointer for train, dev, and test data.
(2) .sent file contains the PubMed abstracts line by line.
(3) .tup file contains the interaction tuples separated the special separatators as shown in Table 1 of our BIBM22 paper for word level decoding. Each line in this file corresponds to the line of .sent file.
(4) .pointer file contains the interaction tuples as shown in Table 1 of our BIBM22 for pointer level decoding. Each line in this file corresponds to the line of .sent file.
(5) interactions.txt contains all the interactions (one at each line).
(6) w2v.txt is the output of Word2Vec. It contains the word vectors of dimension 300.
